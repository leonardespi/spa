# SPA — System for Thought and Action

The **System for Thought and Action (SPA)** is a modular architecture for personal organization that integrates knowledge management, goal planning, and task execution. Unlike other systems, SPA enables the creation of new knowledge by fusing and maturing ideas that come from different life areas.

It is designed as a functional network of components that interact both hierarchically and bidirectionally—from deep thinking to everyday action—through a continuous process of iteration.Full documentation lives in [`/docs`](docs/).
