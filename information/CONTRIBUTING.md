Thank you for your interest in improving SPA. Contributions of all kinds are welcome: bug reports, feature requests, documentation, and code.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Report bugs / request features:** Open an [Issue](https://github.com/leonardespi/spa/issues) with clear steps, expected vs. actual behavior, and environment details.
- **Improve docs:** PRs that clarify concepts, add examples, or translate content are very valuable.
- **Code contributions:** Fix a bug, add a helper script, or improve templates.

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Create a feature branch:

```bash
   git checkout -b feat/<short-name>
````

3. Make focused commits (see style below) and open a PR to `main`.

## Commit & PR Style
